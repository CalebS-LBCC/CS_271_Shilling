Two broad topics I am interested in come from the OSU classes I am taking this term:
Usage of GPUs or similar devices in computing
Programming paradigms aside from object-oriented

Three other topics I am interested in:
Code compilation (transition from readable code to machine code)
Memory manegement and manipulation (Pointers!)
Machine Learning

Difficult Topics:
AI
Machine Learning
Memory management and optimization
Error and Exception handling (what to do if something goes wrong)
Compiler design (how to make a language more efficient)
